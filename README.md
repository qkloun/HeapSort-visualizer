# Welcome
A real-time visualization tool that demonstrates how the Heapsort algorithm organizes data, built with C++ and SDL2.

## About
This project is part of a series visualizing different sorting algorithms. Watching algorithms sort data in real-time helps bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation—seeing Heapsort build and manipulate a heap structure makes the algorithm's mechanics much clearer than reading about it alone.

Through developing this visualization, I:
- Gained a deeper understanding of how Heapsort works internally
- Improved my ability to translate algorithm logic into visual representations
- Learned to use SDL2 for rendering graphics in C++

I hope this tool helps other students grasp sorting algorithms more intuitively, especially those who learn better through visual demonstrations.

## Features
- Real-time visualization of the heap sort algorithm
- Interactive display showing each step of the sorting process
- Highlighted elements to track current operations
- Smooth animations with customizable delay
- Random data generation for varied demonstrations
